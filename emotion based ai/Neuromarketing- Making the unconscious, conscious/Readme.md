## Introduction to Neuromarketing
**Neuromarketing** :- making the subconscious as conscious.
People lie themselves, like they say they want something but they act in a different way and purchase something else. There are several times when people go to superstores to buy some item but end up purchasing several other items but the intended one.

So generally people lie to themselves almost all the time which may be conscious or subconscious, so can we rely on surveys and opinions of customers.Neuromarketing takes an edge over several other marketing measures since it provides insight into automatic responses that take place at the **subconscious level**.

Important insights from neuromarketing strategies that align with our own experiences and beliefs:

- Emotions drive biases and subconscious decision-making.
- Visuals are processed more quickly than words.
- Images of celebrities, beautiful women, children and puppies are universally appealing.
- Faces of any type draw the eye better than other kinds of visuals, and convey important emotional information such as mood, status, etc.
- Messages that consumers find irrelevant reduce their positive responses. Marketing elements that consumers can personally identify with create a positive response.
- When a consumer purchases a product from a brand he or she is loyal to, the reward center of the brain gets activated.
- Prices with round numbers (like Rs 100) are processed more easily, yet numbers like Rs 99.99 are perceived as a better deal.
- Certain colors elicit particular emotional reactions.
- The first and last parts of a message are especially important in setting the context for how a message is perceived.
- Social norms such as reciprocity can be invoked to influence behavior.
- Avoiding pain is often a stronger motivator than seeking pleasure


Neuromarketing is a new and evolving science that can help marketers better understand consumer behavior in order to improve their:
- Packaging
- Pricing
- Brand positioning
- Promotion strategies
- New product development

## About the Dataset
In this Project, I have worked upon detection of emotions from the EEG signals which have been taken from the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset(SEED). This dataset contains emotions of people as per the EEG signal received when they were shown clips of movie trailers.

### How the experiment was conducted?
15 Chinese film clips (positive, neutral and negative emotions) were chosen from the pool of materials as stimuli used in the experiments. The selection criteria for film clips are as follows: (a) The length of the whole experiment should not be too long in case it will make subjects fatigue. (b) The videos should be understood without explanation (c) The videos should elicit a single desired target emotion.

### Arrangement of the experiment
The duration of each film clip is about 4 minutes. Each film clip is well edited to create coherent emotion eliciting and maximize emotional meanings. There are totally 15 trials for each experiment. There is a 5s hint before each clip, 45s for self-assessment and 15s for rest after each clip in one session. The order of presentation is arranged so that two film clips targeting the same emotion are not shown consecutively. For the feedback, participants are told to report their emotional reactions to each film clip by completing the questionnaire immediately after watching each clip. The detailed protocol is shown below:

### Subjects
Fifteen Chinese subjects (7 males and 8 females; MEAN: 23.27, STD: 2.37) participated in the experiments. In order to protect personal privacy, we have hidden their names and indicate each subject with a number from 1 to 15.
