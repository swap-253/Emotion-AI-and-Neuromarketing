## Introduction to Neuromarketing
**Neuromarketing** :- making the subconscious as conscious.
People lie themselves, like they say they want something but they act in a different way and purchase something else. There are several times when people go to superstores to buy some item but end up purchasing several other items but the intended one.

So generally people lie to themselves almost all the time which may be conscious or subconscious, so can we rely on surveys and opinions of customers.Neuromarketing takes an edge over several other marketing measures since it provides insight into automatic responses that take place at the **subconscious level**.

Important insights from neuromarketing strategies that align with our own experiences and beliefs:

- Emotions drive biases and subconscious decision-making.
- Visuals are processed more quickly than words.
Images of celebrities, beautiful women, children and puppies are universally appealing.
Faces of any type draw the eye better than other kinds of visuals, and convey important emotional information such as mood, status, etc.
Messages that consumers find irrelevant reduce their positive responses. Marketing elements that consumers can personally identify with create a positive response.
When a consumer purchases a product from a brand he or she is loyal to, the reward center of the brain gets activated.
Prices with round numbers (like Rs 100) are processed more easily, yet numbers like Rs 99.99 are perceived as a better deal.
Certain colors elicit particular emotional reactions.
The first and last parts of a message are especially important in setting the context for how a message is perceived.
Social norms such as reciprocity can be invoked to influence behavior.
Avoiding pain is often a stronger motivator than seeking pleasure.
